<h1 align="center">WIND RIVER KNOWLEDGE FORUM</h1>
<h2><a name="intro"></a>General / Introductory</h2>
<h5>What is <em>Wind River Knowledge</em> Forum:</h5>
<p>The <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> is one of several Support Tools  available to Wind River Customers. </p>
<p>The <em>Forum</em> has been designed and implemented to be a tool that allows  customers to search for solutions to common problems, ask certain types of  questions and to contribute to the knowledge base by answering questions.</p>
<p>The <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> is not intended to be a Discussion Forum  -  questions that require considerable  back-and-forth transactions, or in-depth investigations, should be routed to  one of Wind River’s other support tools.</p>
<p>It is important to note that  in addition to customer questions, Wind River Customer Support Engineers  actively post Question/Answer pairs based on experience gained during  traditional support of products and tribal knowledge.  Over time the Knowledge Forum should become a significant  knowledge repository of Problem/Solutions Pairs.</p>
<p>It is available at <a href="http://www.ask.windriver.com/" target="_blank">ask.windriver.com</a>.</p>
<div id="warning"><strong>Please be Aware:</strong><br>
  The <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> is an open Support Repository that is  accessible to Wind River Employees and customers that have active Support  Maintenance Agreements.     
<p>Questions posted are visible  to all users and all users can contribute to the answer. Both Questions and  Answers can be edited by every user on <em>Wind  River Knowledge Forum.</em></p>

    <br>
  This <em>Forum</em> is not a platform to argue over information or point out faults of  others.  If a user sees inaccurate,  misleading or malicious information – the content can be voted down or flagged  it as offensive.  Voting down content  moves it down in the knowledge value tree.

  <br>
  If an issue filed on the <em>Wind River  Knowledge Forum</em> becomes out-of-scope for the forum, the user may be  directed to one of the other Wind River Support Services.</p>

<h5><a name="keyword"></a>Keyword search:</h5>
<p>Keyword search is used to  located words within the title, body and answer of <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> question.  The Keyword search box is located on the main <em>Forum</em> page:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="619" height="92" src="userguide_clip_image008.jpg"> </p>
<p>The search facility is  typical and has the following advance searching capabilities (TBD):</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><a name="asking"></a>Asking Questions</h2>
<h5><a name="_Toc330900257">Before posting a question</a> search for an existing solution:</h5>
<p>Before  posting a question on the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>, users should search the <em>Forum</em> for possible solutions to  the same or similar issue.   </p>
<p>Searching can be done via  keyword phrases, tag searches or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>As the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> grows over time, the odds of finding an  existing solution increases so it’s important to spend a bit of time searching  for known problem/solution pairs.   Even  if a solution is not found, searches usually result in gained knowledge and  understanding of related issues.</p>
<h5>What types of questions should be asked:</h5>
<p>After  the <em>Wind  River Knowledge Forum</em> has been searched unsuccessfully for a solution, the user should  determine if the question is of the type intended for the <em>Forum</em>.    </p>
<p><em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> is intended  for<a name="_GoBack"></a> specific type of questions – primarily questions that  meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can be categorized into a concise Question/Answer pair</li>
  <li>Does not contain confidential or proprietary information</li>
  <li>Non-Subjective</li>
  <li>Problems that do not require more than a few back-and-forth iterations</li>
  <li>Problems that do not require significant debug or investigation</li>
  <li>Problems that are not time-critical</li>
</ul>
<p>Open  ended subjective questions, which require discussions and debugging, are not  best suited for <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>. </p>
<p>If  the problem is time-critical it may be best to file an official Technical  Support Request (TSR). This can be done using the TSR Manager link on the forum  page.</p>
<p>Questions  about the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> site itself, or other Wind River websites, should  be avoided. A feedback mechanism is provided on each page as a way to  communicate suggestions or problems with the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> to Wind  River.</p>
<h5>What information should be provided when posting a question:</h5>
<p>After  an unsuccessful search for an existing solution, and qualifying the question as  a good candidate for the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>, a new question can be  posted to the<em> Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>.</p>
<p>When  posting to the<em> Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>, the user will need to  supply enough information in order for Wind River Customer Support, and  possibly non-Wind River personnel, to answer the question.   The format of the Question on the <em>Forum</em> includes the following  fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Question Title Line</li>
  <li>Question Description</li>
  <li>Tags</li>
</ul>
<h5>Question’s title line:</h5>
  Wind  River has hundreds of products, each with thousands of possible questions.  Wind River Customer Support has dedicated  Customer Support Engineers (CSE) assigned to each product area.  No one Customer Support Engineer could know  all products so it’s important to word the question title effectively.</p>
<p>In  addition to finding a possible solution,   searching the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>, prior to posting a  question, gives the user a sense of how question titles should be worded.  Posts with high ratings are usually best to  review for proper format, although, this is not necessarily true for all cases.</p>
<h5>Question description:</h5>
  The  Question Description is obviously the most important part of submitting an  issue on the <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em>.  In addition to supplying a clear and concise description of the  actual problem, it is very important to supply enough information such as  errors, version info, etc on the product or function the problem is applicable  to.</p>
<p>What  constitutes a good Problem Description is very subjective.  It is important to remember that too little  or non-concise information may cause misinterpretation of the problem, delay in  responses, additional back-and-forth inquiries and possibly Wind River Customer  Support Engineer asking submitter that a Technical Support Request (TSR) be  created to receive further assistance on the issue.</p>
<h5><a name="tags"></a>Tags</h5>
  The <em>Wind River Knowledge Forum</em> uses tags extensively.  <br>
  <br>

<h2>Other Features in Knowledge Forum</h2>
<h5>How does karma system work?</h5>
<p>When a question or answer  is upvoted, the user who posted it will gain some points, which are called \&quot;karma  points\&quot;. These points serve as a rough measure of the community’s trust  in him/her. Various moderation tasks are gradually assigned to users based on  these points.<br>
  For example, if you ask  an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your input will be upvoted.  On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will be downvoted. Each vote  in favor will generate <strong>10</strong> points, each vote against will subtract <strong>10</strong> points. There is a limit of <strong>200</strong> points that can be accumulated for a question or answer per day. The table  below explains reputation point requirements for each type of moderation task. </p>

<h5>How to change my picture (gravatar) and what is gravatar?</h5>
<p>The picture that appears  on the users profiles is called <strong>gravatar</strong> (which means <strong>g</strong>lobally <strong>r</strong>ecognized <strong>avatar</strong>).<br>
  Here is how it works: a <strong>cryptographic key</strong> (unbreakable code) is calculated from  your email address. You upload your picture (or your favorite alter ego image)  to the website <a href="http://gravatar.com/"><strong>gravatar.com</strong></a> from where we later retrieve your image using the key.<br>
  This way all the websites  you trust can show your image next to your posts and your email address remains  private.<br>
  Please <strong>personalize your account</strong> with an image - just register  at <a href="http://gravatar.com/"><strong>gravatar.com</strong></a> (please be sure to use the same email address that you  used to register with Wind River Systems). The default image which looks like a  kitchen tile is generated automatically.</p>
